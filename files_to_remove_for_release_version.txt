Certain files need to be removed from a development system before an SD card image is prepared for customer use.

The entire "hats" folder should be deleted. 
This will prevent customers from accidentally corrupting the hat EEPROM contents

All files exept for the executable "jtag" and jtag.ini should be deleted from the jtag folder. 
This will prevent the customer from making unwanted changes to the jtag application.
(ensure new source files are backed-up/returned to source control before deleting!)

2021-08-02 developemnt files have now been moved to ~/jtagdev

~/jtagdev contains the development files and ~jtag is the release appication direcctory

back-up/git the entire ~/jtagdev folder and then remove with rm -rf ~/jtagdev
